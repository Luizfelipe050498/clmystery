<TODO: ASCII art for clues or woman or whatnot>

Take a look inside your 'clues.txt'. What does the third clue tell you? What are the files in the 'mystery' directory you should look next based on this clue?


#### Challenge ####

Sometimes you don't want to see the whole file, but just to peek inside it to get the idea of what the content is. Research `tail` and `head` commands. Try these commands on the files in the 'mystery' directory.

Now you know all the commands you need to find this mysterious woman.

Create a file called 'possible_witnesses.txt' containing the list of all women matching the barista's description and their addresses. Commit and push the file to Github.

If you got stuck look inside 'hint1'. <TODO: update hint1>

Once you've done that go to step3.
